# Auto (or Australian) Patcher
A package manager by scrundaegames
## Installing Packages
Aupatch packages can be installed by running the --install command
<br>Here is an example:<br>
<code>aupatch --install https://scrundae.github.io/apst</code> (This assumes you have Aupatch added to your PATH environment variable or you are in it's install folder)
## Creating packages

To make a package, you need to have the files to the package online. Then, you need to make a master script that installes all these files.
<br>Here's an example:<br>

<code>cast "Installation started"</code>
<br>
<code>install [ FILE URL ] at [ PLACE ON USERS COMPUTER (E.g. Program Files) ]</code>
